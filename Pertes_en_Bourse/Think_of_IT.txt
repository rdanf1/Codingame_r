All functions from discrete integer series (any stream/source of values...)
can be computed in parsing elements as current (v) & previous (prev_v) !?..

=> No need to save in a tab[] !

Elements of the answer :

- It's a property of integers series (N ordonnated) - and recursing : initial, n, n+1

- My recursing def (see Peano !) : If true for initial condition U(0), 
                                   then if it's true for (n), it's true for (n+1) !
