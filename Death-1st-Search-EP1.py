#
# DR - Figuring it out, what structure to implement preferably...
#
# 1) Each inode has its unique Number
# 2) Each inode has its list of connected inodes with unique numbers
# ==> dictionnary of { inode_NÂ°, [Inodes_linked] } seems OK...
# 3) How to build / read / implement structure chosen ?
#
# Conclusions : 
# 1) the Hard part was to get rid of py key error ( initializing / building dict {int,[]} )
# 2) Not optimum : sever when bobnet is at -1 or take his 1st link as given initially
#       => BUT ELEGANT ! ( I think )
# 3) See ENHANCEMENT ( beautiful #04 too := A picture of My method indeed ! )
# 4) TODO : sever the good alternate link to block Bobnet previously... (EP2 ?!..)
#     => I know HOWTO 
#        :==> delete severed + 
#             don't pick previous step of (si) if not near -1 (ei) ( new var : prev_si )
#             (Initials Rules - Not Clever ! - : Dont delete severed, 
#                                                Pick 1st indice of (ei) neighbors if not (-1)... 
# 5) TODO2 : Anticipate (ei) moves [ What IA is behind IT ?!.. Can evolve ?!..  ]
