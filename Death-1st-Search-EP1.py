#
# DR - Figuring it out, what structure to implement preferably...
#
# 1) Each inode has its unique Number
# 2) Each inode has its list of connected inodes with unique numbers
# ==> dictionnary of { inode_NÂ°, [Inodes_linked] } seems OK...
# 3) How to build / read / implement structure chosen ?
#
# Conclusions : 
# 1) the Hard part was to get rid of py key error ( initializing / building dict {int,[]} )
# 2) Not optimum : sever when bobnet is at -1 or take his 1st link as given initially
#       => BUT ELEGANT ! ( I think )
